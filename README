This is a digest of the gnu assembler for riscv machines.
1: To get the software:
Copy the two files (asm.c and asm.h) somewhere in your
machine.
2: Compile it with:
   gcc -o asm asm.c -lz
In some systems, the obtack library is not included in the C library.
If that is the case in your system, the command should be:
   gcc -o asm asm.c obstack.c -lz
There is no Makefile. You can write one if you want.

The documentation is in riscv-doc.pdf

ENJOY!
